# Azure Digital Twins REST API reference

This is the reference documentation for the Azure Digital Twins REST APIs.

The **control plane APIs** are used to manage your Azure Digital Twins instance as a whole, so they cover operations like creating or deleting your entire instance. You will also use these to create and delete endpoints.

The **data plane APIs** are used to manage the elements within your Azure Digital Twins instance, like models and twins. They cover operations like create, delete, update, and list (exact operations vary by topic).
